# Real-Time-Social-Distancing-Violation-Detection
Real-time tool to monitor social distancing violations using cctv cameras

Due to COVID-19, The need of social distancing is mandatory to control the spread of the
disease. People are advised to limit their interactions with other people as much as they
can to reduce the chance of spreading the covid-19 virus with physical or close contact.
In this system we will see how python, computer vision and deep learning model can be
used to monitor social distancing at public places and workplaces or education institutes.
To make sure the people follow social distancing protocols in crowded places, A real time
social distancing detection software that can monitor if people are following the social
distancing protocols by taking real time video streams from the camera. Social distancing
violation detection offers an opportunity for real-time measuring and analysing the physical
distance between pedestrians using real time videos in public spaces. Our solution
focuses on detecting people through real time camera feeds and detect the social distancing
violations by calculating the distance between people in real time. Our system will
also give real time results by pointing out violators in real time and forming red bounding
boxes around them. A violation threshold is defined and when the number of violations
are exceeded from that 180cm threshold then yellow bounding box will appear on that
person and if two persons further get closer to each other then red bounding box will appear.
